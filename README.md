*"Docendo discimus"*

A collection of python notebooks exploring popular methods for rating sports teams (and other things).

I would love feedback on these notebooks, and I am sure there are many errors/possible improvements. Feel free to reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/YaleSportsGroup), email at matthew.robinson@yale.edu, or send a pull request.
